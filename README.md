## Project Description 
- An accident is an uncontrollable incident which happens at times. So our project is focused on “ Car accidents in US” 
- This dataset has been collected in real-time, using multiple Traffic APIs. Currently, it contains accident data that are collected from February 2016 to December 2019 for the Contiguous United States.
- With this dataset we are going to predict the severity using factors such as day, weather, county, state, and various other factors.
- The main audience for this project is civilians and state traffic department. This may help them in containing those accidents..

### 1. Research Question
Road Accidents are a common cause of death, disability, collateral destruction and a significant public health and road safety problem. Accidents are also a significant cause of congestion and delays in the flow. On average, nearly 5,000 people are killed and over 418,000 people are injured in weather-related crashes each year. Being one of the major steps of accident management, accident severity prediction can provide crucial information for emergency responders to evaluate the severity level of accidents, estimate the potential impacts, and implement efficient accident management procedures.

Therefore, we propose a solution to deal with the increased attention that has been directed at accident severity prediction using modeling techniques like Bayesian network and Regression models. <br>

### 2. Domain and Data: Data Description

#### A. Source and Size of Data
This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the United States. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to December 2019, using several data providers, including two APIs that provide streaming traffic incident data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 3.0 million accident records in this dataset.
- ID - This is a unique identifier of the accident record.
- Source - Indicates source of the accident report (i.e. the API which reported the accident.).
- TMC - A traffic accident may have a Traffic Message Channel (TMC) code which provides more detailed description of the event.
- Severity - Shows the severity of the accident, a number between 1 and 4, where 1 indicates the least impact on traffic (i.e., short delay as a result of the accident) and 4 indicates a significant impact on traffic (i.e., long delay).
- Start_Time - Shows start time of the accident in local time zone.
- End_Time - Shows end time of the accident in local time zone.
- Distance(mi) - The length of the road extent affected by the accident.
- City - Shows the city in address field.
- County -Shows the county in address field.
- State - Shows the state in address field.
- Zipcode - Shows the zipcode in address field.
- Country - Shows the country in address field.
- Timezone - Shows timezone based on the location of the accident (eastern, central, etc.).
- Weather_Timestamp - Shows the time-stamp of weather observation record (in local time).
- Temperature(F) - Shows the temperature (in Fahrenheit).
- Wind_Chill(F) - Shows the wind chill (in Fahrenheit).
- Humidity(%) - Shows the humidity (in percentage).
- Pressure(in) - Shows the air pressure (in inches).
- Wind_Direction - Shows wind direction.
- Wind_Speed(mph) - Shows wind speed (in miles per hour).
- Precipitation(in) - Shows precipitation amount in inches, if there is any.
- Weather_Condition - Shows the weather condition (rain, snow, thunderstorm, fog, etc.).

#### B.Tentative plan for analysis on GCP

##### Explratory Data Analysis
- We use Cloud AutoML and will be exploring the data
- For each observation, important subsets are identified
- Interrelationships between various attributes will be observed
- Guessing for possible associations between target variable and predictors
- Looking for associations among the predictors
<br>

##### Preprocessing Phase
- We dig and explore for all the null values and missing values like ‘Number’, ‘End_Lng’, ‘End_Lat’ columns in the dataset.
- We will find and remove all the outliers in the dataset by looking all the columns and finding the values that are very different from the rest of them.
- We will look for various features to find the most relevant ones to use them for predictions like ‘Weather_Timestamp’, ‘Severity’ , etc., from the dataset.
- We will learn what are the columns that are least significant like ‘End_Lng’ and ‘End_Lat’ columns in the dataset and remove them.
- We will use Cloud Dataflow, Google Dataprep and Google Dataproc for cleaning the data and pre-processing the dataset
<br>

##### Dashboard for Users
- A Dashboard is created for users.
- Users dashboard is included with action-oriented features as make it easier for them which will help them refer to or look at what they desire.
